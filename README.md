# Micropython-LLM-Chat-for-M5Stack-CoreS3-ESP32-S3-Box
> **Note:** 2025/3/16 This is the initial version(complete within one day) without full code cleanup. The project will be gradually improved over time.

This project enables real-time audio transcription and conversation with LLMs API like GPT-4 using an M5Stack CoreS3 or ESP32-S3-Box.
## Features
- Voice recording and conversion to text using OpenAI's Whisper API
- Chatting with GPT-4 (or other LLMs)
